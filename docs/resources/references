1. Music DSP - Stuff on Synthesis, Filters, Effects .... cool stuff. You can even find pseudocode for instance of Moog VCF, variation 1: https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/Filters/25-moog-vcf-variation-1.html

2.) Digital Audio Processing Fundamentals . Literally bought this book. Description reads: The book provides an accessible overview of audio signal processing, and enables readers to design and write algorithms for the analysis, synthesis, and manipulation of musical and acoustic signals for any programming language. It provides an overview of highly interdisciplinary topics developed in a simple but rigorous way, and described in a unified and formal language which focuses on determining discrete-time audio signal models. Readers can find within a self-contained volume basic topics ranging over different disciplines: mechanical acoustics, physical systems and linear and nonlinear models, with lumped and distributed parameters; described and developed with the same level of mathematical formalism, easy to understand and oriented to the development of algorithms. Topics include the fundamental concepts of acoustic mechanics and vibration; the design of filters and equalizers for sound signals, the so-called audio effects, abstract methods of sound synthesis, and finally, methods of synthesis by physical modeling.





----- Harmonics 

Hamonic/Inharmonic overtones. The harmonic tones are the tones you can sing and they sound nice. The harmonic is the soundwave relating the fundamental (lowest/root note) as an integer multiple).

Sound source -> Effects -> Control Modules (LFO/ ADSR)

Oscillator (VCO)

Waveforms
Sine
Triangle
Sawtooth
Square

Music 256a                     : 

This course explores the artful design of interactive musical software, tools, instruments, toys, and games. Topics include strategies for crafting interactive systems, audiovisual design, game design, and the aesthetic dimension of shaping technology in our world today. Course work features several programming assignments, short weekly reading responses, an emphasis on critical design feedback, and a "design your own" final project. You will learn to create systems using a combination of audiovisual programming tools including ChuGL (all new). Prerequisite: experience in C/C++, Java, Unity, or Unreal Engine.
