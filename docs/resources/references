1. Music DSP - Stuff on Synthesis, Filters, Effects .... cool stuff. You can even find pseudocode for instance of Moog VCF, variation 1:

2.) Digital Audio Processing Fundamentals . Literally bought this book. Description reads: The book provides an accessible overview of audio signal processing, and enables readers to design and write algorithms for the analysis, synthesis, and manipulation of musical and acoustic signals for any programming language. It provides an overview of highly interdisciplinary topics developed in a simple but rigorous way, and described in a unified and formal language which focuses on determining discrete-time audio signal models. Readers can find within a self-contained volume basic topics ranging over different disciplines: mechanical acoustics, physical systems and linear and nonlinear models, with lumped and distributed parameters; described and developed with the same level of mathematical formalism, easy to understand and oriented to the development of algorithms. Topics include the fundamental concepts of acoustic mechanics and vibration; the design of filters and equalizers for sound signals, the so-called audio effects, abstract methods of sound synthesis, and finally, methods of synthesis by physical modeling.

This course explores the artful design of interactive musical software, tools, instruments, toys, and games. Topics include strategies for crafting interactive systems, audiovisual design, game design, and the aesthetic dimension of shaping technology in our world today. Course work features several programming assignments, short weekly reading responses, an emphasis on critical design feedback, and a "design your own" final project. You will learn to create systems using a combination of audiovisual programming tools including ChuGL (all new). Prerequisite: experience in C/C++, Java, Unity, or Unreal Engine.

https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/68278/coding-an-lfo-in-c

"Glad it worked out for you. The LFO I sent you modulates the amplitude of the signal using a constant frequency, but if you want to modulate the frequency of the input signal, it's best to use complex numbers and a slightly different mixing function. What you have created is a chirp by varying the rate of change of the phase (lfo variable in your case), i.e. not using a constant step for your phase increment. â€“
